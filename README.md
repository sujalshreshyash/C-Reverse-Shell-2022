How to use:
- Open the TcpReverseShell.sln and navigate to TcpReverseShell.cpp
- Open a terminal in your linux and start netcat listener, for eg. nc â€“lvp 4444
- Replace "Your Static IP" and "Your Open Port" with your IP and Port respectively. 
- Build the solution
- The .exe will generate in this folder (location may vary) - C++ FUD Reverse Shell\TcpReverseShell-main\C++ Reverse Shell FUD 2022\x64
- Run your .exe file and voila - no detection, no bullshit just pure reverse shell connection to your netcat listener server.
